_Last updated: 2025-08-07_

## Introduction  
PigCatLedger (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is an app for personal expense and income tracking. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## 1. Data We Collect  
- **Receipt Text**  
  When you use the “AI Auto Bookkeeping” feature, you enter transaction descriptions or amounts as text.  
- **Usage Analytics (Optional)**  
  Anonymous app-usage events (e.g. feature taps, session lengths) solely to help us improve stability and usability.

## 2. How We Use Your Data  
- **AI Parsing**  
  Your transaction text is sent to our AI provider (Zhiju AI) for natural-language parsing.  
- **Local Storage**  
  All transaction records (amount, date, category, notes) are stored locally on your device unless you choose to sync via iCloud.  
- **Analytics**  
  If enabled, anonymous analytics help us understand which features are most useful.

## 3. Third-Party Services  
- **Zhiju AI**  
  • **Purpose**: NLP parsing of your transaction text  
  • **Data Sent**: Only the plain text you enter  
  • **Data Retention**: Zhiju AI processes and returns parsed results, then deletes all submitted data immediately  
- **Apple iCloud (Optional)**  
  • **Purpose**: Synchronize your data across devices  
  • **Data Stored**: Your encrypted transaction records  

## 4. Data Retention & Deletion  
- Parsed results and app data remain on your device until you delete them.  
- You can clear your “AI Auto Bookkeeping” history in Settings at any time.  

## 5. Security  
We use standard industry practices to secure your data on device and in transit (TLS encryption). We do **not** sell or rent your personal data.

## 6. Children  
PigCatLedger is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.
